  For our October meetup we go beyond product and development techniques and learn about what it takes to manage and communicate in projects and what it takes to make your product stand out.

    <p>
      Rails Girls Summer of Code is a global event which focuses on bringing more women into the world of open source software and helping participants to further expand their knowledge and skills in programming. 33 students got the chance to work paid and full-time on their projects, attend tech conferences and even speak on them. This all wouldn´t haven been possible without a great team of volunteers, organizers and sponsors. Lisa (implementing the webdesign) and Rebecca (adding illustrations) will talk a little more about the organisation and their involvement.

    <p>
      Besides the skills specific to our job, a huge part of building digital products is about communicating with other people. The better we understand our clients’, bosses’ and colleagues’, and the better we are at helping them understand us and what we do, the better the project will turn out and the less stress we are likely to generate.
      Some general thoughts on a more empathetic approach to communication and a list of specific ideas to improve understanding and avoid communication breakdowns.

    <p class="speaker_info">
      Rome-born, Berlin-based Francesco is a caffeine addict who toils away day and sometimes night as a freelance UX designer and project manager for various web agencies and startups in Berlin in order to support his tragic habit. He tries his best not to increase the pervasive ugliness and thoughtlessness, for bad design makes him weep.

    <p>
      Our digital life is bombarded by apps. However, we use few of them on a daily basis. This does
      not mean that the other apps are not well­designed, this is basically because they are unable to
      make mark in our life and to create a habit for us. This talk endeavours to explore what we
      deliver behind our apps.
